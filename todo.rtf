\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 To do:
\b0 \
\
Predict multiple stats at once. - arrayLSTM already prepares lags, but model builder does not\
\
Build more elaborate result assessments.\
\
Build function to prepare a pred-from array for latest year - needed to predict next year!\
\
Consider data engineering trick to emphasize high-end scorers or debias the mid-range ones.\
\
Add more complex functions to LMN\
\
Build out more complex flows - iterations, to create probabilistic predictions, test parameters\
\
\

\b Competed:\
\

\b0 Create new repo and ensure that the old scripts work properly.\
\
Update the db with 20182019 stats - may require adjustments to nhl.com requests\
\
The pyramid Neural Network appeared to produce results with wider (more realistic) error. Build this in. Try some sort of recursive way of defining this?\
\
Created the LMN library  the _basic functions are completed, including a function to generate a basic result assessment \
\
Calculated points on stat extraction instead of extracting from db.}
